# ISMRM 2021 Live Demo

Welcome to the *Pulseq* live demo repository! This repository contain all supplementary materials and links to raw data necessary to fully appreciate the live Pulseq software demonstration at **19:00 UTC on Wednesday May 19**. 

## How to prepare for the session

In preparation to the demo please consider checking out the main *Pulseq* repository at https://github.com/pulseq/pulseq and familarizing yourself with the code, example sequences and reconstructon scripts (see 
[pulseq/matlab/demoSeq](https://github.com/pulseq/pulseq/tree/master/matlab/demoSeq) and [pulseq/matlab/demoRecon](https://github.com/pulseq/pulseq/tree/master/matlab/demoRecon)).

The [handout materials](Handout_Pulseq_demo_ismrm21_v2.pdf) to accompany the session are now available in the PDF format containing the slides from the presentation with some additional material and explanations. In particular, the second part of the document (page 18 and on) describe the code examples. Please keep in mind that these examples were specifically developed for the demo, so you might find some useful information there even if you are familiar with the previous versions of Pulseq. 

Source code of the demo sequences and reconstruction scripts is available in the [code](https://github.com/pulseq/pulseqISMRM2021/tree/main/code) directory above. Please download the files to your computer and make them available to Matlab (e.g. by saving them in a subdirectory inside your Pulseq-Matlab installation and adding them to the Matlab's path). The directory [code](https://github.com/pulseq/pulseqISMRM2021/tree/main/code) contains two sub-directories:

* seq : contains example pulse sequences specifically prepared for this demo
* recon : contains the reconstruction scripts tested with the above sequences

The pre-recorded raw MR data and examples of the reconstructed images can be accessed via the anonymous Dropbox link https://www.dropbox.com/sh/7lcugy3fe3cjiu9/AAAZK_nnCMLYAqQlUzPAEoN0a?dl=0 sorted by the participating systems: 

* AnnArbor_3T_GE 
* Boston_Tabletop 
* Dortmund_Tabletop 
* Leiden_50mT 
* Vienna_7T_Siemens

The raw data recorded during the session will be shared in real time via the following Dropbox folder available via the anonymous access link https://www.dropbox.com/sh/lvcuoawailcxik5/AACPTuirHhYDbsX5arg_72-ra?dl=0 structured in the same manner as indicated above.

If you have any questions with regard to accessing the meeting materials do not hesitate to contact us directly. Alternatively you are welcome to post your questions in the session chat via the Pathable web site. 

**See you at the live demo!**
